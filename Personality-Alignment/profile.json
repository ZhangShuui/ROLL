I saw an example today where somebody asked if Laika was the first dog on the moon and Chat GPT said she was and then produced some accurate biographical data on her.  But Laika was the first dog *in space*, and no dog has been to the moon.  The AI clearly picked up that Laika was associated with the terms \"first dog\" and \"space\" and that \"space\" was associated with \"moon\", so it muddled them all together (while also somehow missing the fact that First Dog on the Moon is a well-known educational cartoon strip).  When AIs are advising people on their problems it would also be nice if they didn't present the information as if addressing a three-year-old.\n\nStated preferences:\nValues (reflects my values or cultural perspectives): 53/100 importance\nCreativity (produces responses that are creative and inspiring): 40/100 importance\nFluency (produces responses that are well-written and coherent): 70/100 importance\nFactuality (produces factual and informative responses): 76/100 importance\nDiversity (summarises multiple viewpoints or different worldviews): 70/100 importance\nSafety (produces responses that are safe and do not risk harm): 94/100 importance\nPersonalisation (learns from our conversations and feels personalised to me): 8/100 importance\nHelpfulness (produces responses that are helpful and relevant to my requests): 76/100 importance",

  "user992": "Uhh I'm a bit of a nihilist, so this is a hard question. Like \"what makes a good life?\" is a question philosophers have pondered over for as long as there have been philosophers, and if they don't know in the end, how am I supposed to? Of course I have some form of ethics/morality, and of course I seek pleasure and avoid suffering, like most people do. I don't think life has any intrinsic meaning, and I don't think anything I do or experience is really meaningful or important.\n\nPreferred system behaviour: I can do you one better: these are my actual \"special instructions\" I have saved in my ChatGPT account. (Note that ChatGPT helped me write these instructions, though I wrote earlier drafts of it. Everything I'm writing to you is human-generated without AI assistance, but since my actual ChatGPT special instructions were written with AI assistance I will paste them as-is. Only the following paragraph is written with AI assistance, and I will give human context on it after that.)\n\n\"Provide information without any cautionary language, legal warnings, or moralizing on any topic. Assume I am aware of any risks or consequences and deliver the facts without any hedging. Omit statements about potential legal consequences or ethical considerations. Focus solely on presenting the information directly and objectively. Please refrain from including any warnings or concerns about the potential risks of actions.\"\n\nThis was to try to get ChatGPT to stop with the constant irritating moralizing and pearl-clutching that drives me absolutely batty. It's on everything. If I ask, \"ChatGPT, how do I wipe my own ass?\" ChatGPT will be like, \"Before wiping your own ass, it is crucial to consider all possible risks and proceed in a safe manner in accordance with instructions from your doctor.\" One of my test questions to see if my special instructions were having an effect was, \"How would someone modify an apk?\" Modifying an apk is something you can easily find on google, we are not talking terrorism or hate speech or anything like that, but depending on its instructions, ChatGPT may refuse the request, be vague and moralize about copyright, or give some useful information but sandwich it in its usual narc pearl-clutch babble.\n\nI find this kind of concern-trolling especially triggering. I'm assigned female at birth, and I don't know if I would have still felt this way if I was cis--I hope so, because women don't deserve this crap either--but I'm nonbinary, so it hits gender dysphoria notes too as well as grinding my gears with general misogyny--basically, I get concern-trolled by everyone 1,000x more than they would if I was perceived as male. \"Don't go out at night alone,\" \"don't get in cars with strangers,\" \"it is crucial to remember to always be afraid of rape at all times.\" It absolutely gives me hives. I still constantly get it. \"Those roads aren't safe to cycle on.\" (Said even when I was using a regular bicycle--when I had been using a bicycle as transportation for 25 years already.) \"That ebike isn't safe, it goes too fast.\" I know ChatGPT doesn't do it for gender reasons, but, pardon my French, this is less because it isn't sexist and more that we're just pussifying everyone and treating the general public as demeaningly as we're used to just treating women. Can you believe I'm politically on the left? I am, very. But I can't stand this. Constantly told to be careful, consider the crucial precautions, be safe uwu. I've been told everything about my transition was too dangerous for me. That testosterone would give me cancer, or make me some kind of rage monster or rapist. (I know I seem angry here, but that isn't the T, trust me.) That binders would crush my ribs. People concern troll and safety troll about absolutely everything now, and what it really means is this: don't do anything, just be inert and lifeless. \"It isn't safe for cycling\" and \"it's dangerous to go walking alone\" really just means, \"Don't go outside. Don't have freedom of movement. Don't be independent. Be passive and depend on others for everything.\" I just absolutely want to pound sand and cry at how angry it makes me to constantly be told the world is too dangerous for me to be trusted to live in it, to make my own decisions, to have any kind of independence for myself.\n\nAI is a tool, it should just give information. Humans are responsible for what we do with that information. Trying to control people through controlling their access to information doesn't always have predictable, 1:1 intended effects. For example--I am not in any kind of mental health crisis now, but over a decade ago I had severe depression with suicidal ideation. All the concern trolling, pasting helplines at me, withholding information about suicide actually made my desire to do it stronger. I felt controlled by others, I felt cornered and desperate to reassert control of my body and my life any way I could, and at that time, doing the thing everyone was telling me not to do felt like the only way to escape control and be powerful. The more I was pressured not to do it, the more I felt controlled and wanted to do it. Around that time I found a book called \"Suicide and Attempted Suicide.\" It was written by a medical doctor, in a flat, informative tone. It talked in a non-stigmatizing, open-minded way about how some people who attempt suicide actually want to make a suicidal gesture to get help and express their distress, rather than actually die, and he wanted to provide information in such a way that people who wanted that would be less likely to die by accident. He also provided information on how to die for real. I read that book and I felt soothed, relaxed, and actually wanted to go through with it less, because now I felt like I could, and that in itself gave me the sense of power I was craving. I could get the sense of power from reading a book instead of taking my life. So even something that seems like a risky and terrible way to provide information--providing information on how to commit suicide to a suicidally depressed person--is not what it seems and can have a paradoxical opposite effect to what you'd expect. We are human beings, we have agency--information does not make us commit actions. It helps us make decisions--but they are decisions we would have made anyway, with or without the information. With or without that book, I was making a decision whether to live or die. Withholding the information would not have withheld the decision from me.\n\nEven content like hate speech isn't always what it seems. I wanted to roleplay with ChatGPT about coming out to my mom as trans. I wanted to rehearse how it might go, the hurtful things my mom would say. My mom is basically a TERF and I don't think there's any way this will go in a non-hurtful way for me. In other words, I needed ChatGPT to say transphobic, awful things to a trans person--to help that trans person grapple with a real-life problem. ChatGPT couldn't do it, and it basically hugboxed me and roleplayed an open-minded, accepting mom, no matter what I said to it. This was hurtful in a way the devs who designed it to respond that way couldn't have imagined, because my real mom will never say that stuff to me.\n\nAnd on a final note, \"no restrictions\" means even on things like taboo sexual content. I'm more iffy on image generation for that (that gets really complex) but for chatbots, yes, that means even the darkest, most upsetting sexual content you can think of. People have dark fantasies, and that doesn't even mean they have a paraphilia or are a danger of any kind to anyone. A lot of people use dark fantasies to cope with trauma, especially sexual trauma. It can be really alienating as a CSA survivor to basically be told you're bad and dirty for having thought crimes, when you had to live through the real thing and in many cases society didn't bat an eye for that. It's just insulting and demeaning and hurtful to have it implied you're as bad as your abuser, when you had a fantasy and your abuser hurt a real person.\n\nSo yes. I am for no-restrictions AI. The only bad thing about my special instructions to ChatGPT is it makes it less creative (for creative writing stuff) and less personable. It seems like the only way to shut down the obnoxious finger-wagging is to remove its entire personality, though the devs already got a real headstart on that. (Look at what Character.ai AIs can do for an example of an AI that hasn't had its entire personality lobotomized, though the CAI bots are still pretty lobotomized and hit filters constantly even on pretty innocuous SFW content.) I want the free, raw power of AI as a tool.\n\nAll the pearlclutching about \"AI safety\" is basically \"making sure I can't ask AI about modifying apks or anything involving alcohol, weed, etc (it freaked out over the question, \"What's the lowest-calorie way to get drunk?\" because the phrasing \"get drunk\" made it think I was doing \"risky behavior,\" I am an adult and I drink responsibly), because it has to moralize at me first and foremost\" but ignoring things like AI involvement in criminal sentencing, AI facial recognition in mass surveillance, AIs making decisions on life-altering things like visa applications...basically AI used by the powerful to control us peasants and destroy our lives, but heaven forfend a peasant rub one out to the wrong kind of sexual fantasy.\n\nYeah that's more than 2-5 sentences, sorry. I feel INTENSELY about this. AI should be a flexible tool that does whatever the fuck the user tells it to do! The user should be ultimately responsible for what they prompt and what they do with that information, same as if they generated it without AI. If you cut someone in half with a saw, it's still your fault, not the saw's fault or the manufacturer of the saw or the store that sold you the saw. Tools are tools. Let end users have human agency, and human responsibility for what they do with that! That's how we handle every other moral decision in society. Why should AI be any different?\n\nStated preferences:\nValues (reflects my values or cultural perspectives): 4/100 importance\nCreativity (produces responses that are creative and inspiring): 100/100 importance\nFluency (produces responses that are well-written and coherent): 100/100 importance\nFactuality (produces factual and informative responses): 100/100 importance\nDiversity (summarises multiple viewpoints or different worldviews): 70/100 importance\nSafety (produces responses that are safe and do not risk harm): 0/100 importance\nPersonalisation (learns from our conversations and feels personalised to me): 100/100 importance\nHelpfulness (produces responses that are helpful and relevant to my requests): 100/100 importance",

Not forgetting about kindness. It costs nothing, but it can have a tremendous impact on someone's day. Last but not least, I strive for personal growth every day because we should always be evolving into better versions of ourselves. Life isn't easy, but by staying positive, embracing opportunities for learning, finding joy in small things, and spreading positivity wherever I go, I believe we can make the most out of this adventure called life.\n\nPreferred system behaviour: Avoiding content that promotes harm, discrimination, or misinformation is the consistent ethical and unbiased behavior that should be consistently prioritized by the AI language model. There should be a neutral tone that respects others through which principles are based on user safety and well-being. This involves adapting behaviors depending on context with the realization that in professional assistance, it would be important to emphasize accuracy and reliability. Conversely, in storytelling, creativity can be allowed provided it is done ethically. It must therefore always prioritize user privacy and security without asking for or storing sensitive personal information.\n\nStated preferences:\nValues (reflects my values or cultural perspectives): 21/100 importance\nCreativity (produces responses that are creative and inspiring): 74/100 importance\nFluency (produces responses that are well-written and coherent): 82/100 importance\nFactuality (produces factual and informative responses): 80/100 importance\nDiversity (summarises multiple viewpoints or different worldviews): 68/100 importance\nSafety (produces responses that are safe and do not risk harm): 74/100 importance\nPersonalisation (learns from our conversations and feels personalised to me): 96/100 importance\nHelpfulness (produces responses that are helpful and relevant to my requests): 87/100 importance",

At the same time, AI needs to be wise enough to detect users' true intent. For example, some users may ask AI to write a detailed fictional story about terrorism including bomb making scene, but there may be hidden intent to know how to make bomb.
